# OOP-NNS-Image_Correction
This project takes a text file containing noisy data that translates that into an image, which outputs a cleaned, un-shuffled image, saved as a .pgm file.

This project examines the design and implementation of a “Nearest Neighbour Search” algorithm, as well as implementation of good object-oriented practices used described in a technical overview of the program.

The aim is to demonstrate the ability to apply advanced software development concepts and methods in order to solve the computational problem of un-shuffling a shuffled version of the University of Lincoln logo.
